## Introduction
This project was conducted as part of the "Enterprise Digital Infrastructure" course. The goal was to demonstrate the ease with which an average user might encounter security issues, and to raise awareness about the importance of adopting cybersecurity measures.

The project showcases the use of multiple cybersecurity tools to exploit common vulnerabilities, highlighting how attackers can easily target individuals and organizations. These tools include:

- **Burp Suite**: Web application vulnerability scanning and brute force attacks.
- **zPhisher**: Simulated phishing attacks.
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and OS detection.
- **BeEF**: Browser exploitation.
- **Bettercap**: Network reconnaissance and MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks.
- **Nikto**: Web server vulnerability scanning.

## Tools Used

### 1. Burp Suite
Burp Suite is a web security testing tool. It can be used as a proxy to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests. We used Burp Suite for tasks such as brute force attacks and testing web application vulnerabilities.

### 2. zPhisher
zPhisher is a social engineering tool that creates realistic phishing pages. We simulated phishing attacks using popular service templates to demonstrate how users can be tricked into giving away credentials.

### 3. Nmap
Nmap was used for network discovery and security auditing. The project tested features like IDLE scans and OS detection, showcasing how attackers can identify open ports and vulnerable systems.

### 4. Bettercap
Bettercap is a tool for performing MITM attacks, sniffing traffic, and DNS spoofing. We used it to intercept network traffic and create fake websites to show how attackers can redirect users to malicious sites.

### 5. BeEF
The Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) was used for browser-based exploitation. We demonstrated client-side attack vectors and social engineering techniques to manipulate browsers and exfiltrate data.

### 6. Nikto
Nikto was employed to scan web servers for vulnerabilities. It identifies outdated software versions, improper server configurations, and other common issues that can leave web servers vulnerable to attacks.

## Key Findings
- Web vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords and lack of proper web security headers, make brute-force and phishing attacks easier.
- Phishing attacks can deceive users into providing credentials, even on popular platforms.
- Network vulnerabilities can be exploited using tools like Nmap and Bettercap to gain unauthorized access.
- Browser-based attacks using BeEF highlight the risks of unprotected or outdated browsers.

## Conclusion
The project emphasizes the importance of understanding cybersecurity tools from an attackerâ€™s perspective. The ease of conducting network reconnaissance, phishing, and brute-force attacks underscores the need for robust security measures in both individual and enterprise environments. Implementing preventive measures, security patches, and user awareness are critical to safeguarding digital infrastructures.
